## Installation

### Theme

The theme is based on the wonderfully clean [ys](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/ys.zsh-theme) theme from the official [oh-my-zsh repo](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

Honukai comes in two flavors, the normal and minimum â€“ see screenshots for reference.

1. Drop `honukai.zsh-theme` into the `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/` directory
2. Change the theme variable name to `ZSH_THEME="honukai"` in `~/.zshrc`
3. Reload ZSH with `source ~/.zshrc`

### Colors

1. Open **Preferences** pane on the **Profiles** tab in iTerm
2. Switch to the **Colors** tab and import the `honukai.itermcolors` (drop-down in the lower right corner)

### Extra eye-candy

There's a bunch of settings you might want to change in your profile in order to get the extra eye-candy.

#### **Text** tab:

**Cursor**

- Set to **Vertical**

**Font**

- Change to **[12pt Fira Mono Medium]()** (I personally love the Fira font-face, and highly suggest using it)
- Enable **Anti-aliased**

**Text Rendering**

- Disable **Draw bold in bold font**
- Disable **Draw bold in bright colors**
- Enable **Draw anti-aliased text with thin strokes**

#### **Window** tab

**Window appearance**

- **Transparency** to **10-15%**
- **Blur** to **40-50%**
